[2025-06-23 16:32:44] === EXPERIMENT 3: IMBALANCE IMPACT STUDY (ENHANCED) ===
[2025-06-23 16:32:44] CRITICAL FINDING: Fairness interventions FAIL for Brazil (-3.0%) and India (-3.5%)
[2025-06-23 16:32:44] Objective: Test if different imbalance scenarios can make fairness interventions work
[2025-06-23 16:32:44] Enhancement: Comprehensive analysis with breakthrough detection and detailed metrics
